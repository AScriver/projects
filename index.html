                My name is Austin Scriver and I am currently enrolled in the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered through the University of Arizona. I had previously attended UofA to persue a chemistry degree, but ended dropping out my junior year as I no longer felt chemistry was the career path for me. <br><br> During my enrollment at the University of Arizona, I researched and studied with the Pyun Research Group as an undergraduate where I was responsible synthesizing high sulfur content polysulfides.<br><br> I have tried to teach myself code multiple times over the past 6 years, but something would come up or I would get discouraged after getting stuck on a hard concept for a few days. I saw an advertisment for this bootcamp on facebook and decided to have a look into the curriculum. After reviewing all the topics that would be covered, I decided it was time to take my coding experience to the next level, and become a full-stack developer. Knowing that this bootcamp would really test my ability to buckle down and get things done, I completed as many of the courses on Freecodecamp, Khan Academy, and Udemy as I could in the time leading up to it. After getting over the initial speedbump of learning my first programming language (html) it was not hard to keep up the motivation. The weight off the sholders of finally getting an element to do what you want it to in CSS is an amazing feeling. I look forward to taking a deeper dive into JavaScript, as that, in my opinion, is one of the qualifications of finally being able to say I am a web developer.</p>
